		<h5 class="center"> Nanoparticles vs. Cancer </h5>
        <p class="light">
		<h6> <b> Some of the biggest advances coming in modern medicine may also be the tiniest. </b> </h6>
		<p>
		For a few decades, scientists have been learning how to design molecules 
		that can operate in the human body. We’re talking about tiny particles that can manipulate 
		biological processes—designed to bind to and thus block the enzyme essential 
		for HIV replication, to help destroy tumors but not healthy cells, to weld together arteries after surgery.
		</p>
		<p>
		On this small a level, also known as the nanoscopic scale or  nanoscale , chemists 
		are building and manipulating matter as small as atoms, small molecules, proteins, antibodies,
		and DNA bases that are less than 100 nanometers wide. These objects are much smaller than 
		the cells in your body. Many are even tinier than the whisper-thin membrane that holds a human cell together.
		</p>
		<p>
		Nanoparticles’ size makes them particularly useful against foes such as 
		cancer. Unlike normal blood vessels that branch smoothly and flow in the same 
		direction, blood vessels in tumors are a disorderly mess. And just as grime builds up 
		in bad plumbing, nanoparticles, it seems, can be designed to build up in these problem growths.
		</p>
		<p>
		<img src="img/logo/medycyna/1.jpg" class="left" style="padding:1%;width:50%;height:50%" alt="Cancer"> This quirk of tumors has led to a bewildering number of nanotech-related schemes to kill cancer.
		The classic approach involves stapling drugs to nanoparticles that ensure delivery to tumors but not to
		healthy parts of the body. A wilder method involves things like using a special kind of nanoparticle that 
		absorbs infrared light. 
		Shine a laser through the skin on the build-up, and the particles will heat up to fry the tumor from
		the inside out.
		</p>
		<p>
		Using lasers to cook tumors sounds like a great reason to 
		throw chemotherapy out the window, except that it’s nearly impossible to foresee all 
		of the possible pitfalls of unleashing particles so small. There are countless different
		substances in each human cell, and it’s very hard to check how a molecule would interact
		with every one of them. Chemists are good at predicting narrower outcomes, such as how a particular
		molecule will work on its intended target, but they have had to resort to rough approximation to try 
		to predict all of the possible interactions new nanoscale creations would have throughout the body. 
		For instance, one particle turned out to be remarkably sticky. A whole blob of 
		proteins stuck all over the particle like hair on a ball of tape, keeping it from even reaching its target.
		</p>
		<p>
		here have been a number of success stories in which scientists were able
		design and release new molecules with confidence, as with the HIV drug Viracept.
		But the difficulty of computing the myriad of possible interactions has been the major
		limiting factor stalling widespread use. It’s not all sunshine and cancer cures.
		Nanoparticles have real risks.
		</p>
		<p>
		Take nanotubes, tiny superstrong cylinders. Remember using lasers
		to cook tumors? That involves nanotubes. Researchers also want to use
		nanotubes to regrow broken bones and connect brains with computers. 
		Although they hold a lot of promise, certain kinds of long carbon nanotubes 
		are the same size and shape as asbestos. Both are fibers thin enough to pierce
		deep inside the lungs but too long for the immune system to engulf and destroy. 
		Mouse experiments have already suggested that inhaling these nanotubes causes the same harmful effects 
		(such as a particularly deadly form of cancer) as the
		toxic mineral once widely used in building insulation.
		</p>
		<p>
		<img src="img/logo/medycyna/2.jpg" class="left" style="padding:1%;width:50%;height:50%" alt="Carbon nanotube"> Shorter nanotubes, however, don’t seem to be dangerous.
		Nanoparticles can be built in all sorts of different ways, 
		and it’s difficult to predict which ones will go bad. Imagine if houses with three
		bathrooms gave everyone in them lung disease, while houses with two or
		four bathrooms were safe. It gets to the central difficulty of these
		nanoscale creations—the unforeseen dangers that could be the difference between biomiracle and bioterror.
		</p>
		<p>
		<h5 class="center"> Unforeseen dangers could be the difference between biomiracle and bioterror. </h5>
		
		Enter  machine learning , 
		that big shiny promise to solve all of our complicated problems.
		The field holds a lot of potential when it comes to handling questions 
		where there are many possible right answers. Scientists often take inspiration 
		from nature—evolution, ant swarms, even our own brains—to teach machines the rules
		for making predictions and producing outcomes without explicitly giving them step-by-step 
		programming. Given the right inputs and guidelines, machines can be as good or even better 
		than we are at recognizing and acting 
		on patterns and can do so even faster and on a larger scale than humans alone are capable of pulling off.
		
		<p>
		In earlier days, scanners could only recognize letters of specific fonts.
		Today, after feeding computers tens of thousands of examples of handwritten digits 
		to detect and extrapolate patterns from, ATMs are now reading handwriting on checks. 
		In nanotechnology, the research is similar: Just like many slightly different shapes can
		mean the same letter, many slightly different molecules can mean the same effect. 
		Setting up a computer to learn how different nanoparticles might interact with the complex human 
		body can assist with what were previously impossibly complex computations to predict billions 
		of possible outcomes.
		</p>
		<p>
		“[F]or this to be a useful thing to do it doesn’t have to be perfect,” Rob Nishihara,
		a University of California, Berkeley, machine learning Ph.D. student and Facebook veteran 
		(and a friend of mine), told me over email. 
		“[E]ven a coarse estimate could really help narrow down the search space and propose candidate molecules.”
		</p>
		<p>
		Here’s how it works. You put different kinds of nanoparticles in with cells and 
		run dozens of experiments changing up variables 
		such as particle lengths, materials, electrical properties, and so on. This gives you a training set.
		</p>
		<p>
		Then you let your machine-learning algorithm loose to learn from the 
		training set. After a few minutes of computation, it builds a model of what mattered. 
		From there comes the nerve-wracking 
		part; you give the machine a test set—data similar to but separate from your training set—and see how it does.
		</p>
		<p>
		A good example is an experiment carried out by 
		the University of California, Los Angeles’ Rong Liu and his colleagues,
		published in 2011. This research team studied metal oxide nanoparticles—think 
		tiny spheres of rust. These particles are potentially useful for MRI scans; they 
		can provide contrast, giving doctors a clearer view of what’s going on inside the body. 
		This makes it easier to diagnose disease or damage. The researchers put different varieties
		of these particles in petri dishes with cells taken from human throat lining. The team 
		observed which particles damaged the cells’ membranes, and then divided that data into 
		a training set and a test set. Their best model correctly predicted which particles 
		would damage cells in the test set. In fact, it predicted which particles would do damage
		with 100 percent accuracy.
		</p>
		<p>
		One hundred percent accuracy sounds like a great accomplishment.
		But machine learning experts get skeptical when they see performance that high. 
		The problem is that machine-learning algorithms sometimes do well on the training 
		set but then fail when applied
		to the new inputs of their first test. Or, even worse, they do well on the first tests for the wrong reasons.
		</p>
		<p>
		One famous example of this happened a few years ago when  Google Flu Trends 
		made waves for accurately “nowcasting” how many people had the flu. The initiative
		based its estimates on the patterns its algorithms had found in how search trends lined
		up with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data on flu prevalence during a particular
		window of time. Although its real-time flu forecasts seemed to square with the numbers of CDC-tracked
		cases released with a two-week delay, its potentially 
		life-saving predictive success didn’t last long. In fact, in subsequent years it failed rather dramatically.
		</p>
		<p>
		It turned out that the algorithm was simply recognizing terms that people search a lot
		in winter, like “high school basketball.” It was just a coincidence that the number of people 
		searching about basketball and the number of people getting the flu matched up so 
		well the first year, and unsurprisingly it didn’t work in the long term. A human would never make that mistake.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not to say that big data can’t be valuable, and advances
		in machine learning will absolutely lead to huge breakthroughs for nanomedicine. 
		But it is reason to not turn the algorithms loose and let them do all the thinking,
		especially when the stakes are as high as letting new creations loose in our amazingly complex, 
		fine-tuned human bodies. As the lower-stakes Google Flu Trends failure taught us, machines will
		need a lot more data before we can trust them to make predictions 
		and, in some cases, a human hand to help transform the variables the machine starts with into more useful ones.
		</p>
		<p>
		Here it’s useful to think of the example of the spam filter, one
		of machine learning’s greatest successes. When programmers just threw the 
		text of a spam email into a prediction function, it only learned how to stop 
		messages with wording very similar to the training examples. Tell the function to take 
		into account a wider range of variables,
		such as the number of dollar signs, or percentage of all-caps words, and they got a much higher success rate.
		</p>
		<p>
		The same goes for nanoparticles—the research done so
		far has shown that it’s not just crude variables such as size and mass that need to
		be taken into account but also properties such as  texture, circularity, surface material, 
		and surface charge  that seem to be the best predictors
		of whether they will harm cells. And, although it’s difficult to generalize with this, letting the machines
		work with good data (and lots of it) seems to be more important than the learning algorithm researchers use.
		</p>
		<p>
		It gets back to why many machine learning methods take cues from the natural
		world—immune systems, bird flocks, and counting trees have all
		informed successful predictive processes.
		</p>
		<p>
		Nature is quirky and irregular. This is especially true on the nanoscale.
		Which is why systems that are themselves quirky, irregular, and 
		shaped over time and trial may be the best way to understand it. 
		It does mean, however, that we will have to wait.
